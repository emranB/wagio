          We donate to environmental start-up companies that involve in the areas of wildlife and green life, which would be our main priority and target. We want to try to be involved in every company possible trying to make a change in this environment. We will also target a lot of other foundations off course, but we DO NOT participate or consider partnering with medical researches or treatments as there are plenty of foundations and companies for that, which makes us unique.
